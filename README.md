# propublica_nonprofit_api
Here's a project I just started in order analyze data from other nonprofits in the Baltimore area.

I used Propublica's Nonprofit Explorer APIv2 to pull more than 7,000 results on nonprofit orgs 
serving the greater Baltimore region.

Our hope is to use this data to:
- Identify similar organizations to partner with.
- Analyze budget, staffing, and services of orgs in our community
- Uncover insights into how we can maximize efficiency in our invoicing, RFPs,
  staffing, salaries, and services.
